How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to quickly find the issue. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If the files are large, it'll be faster to find information out about any changes, updates, etc. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: know when you have saved and not have multiple diffs
    Cons: forgetting to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    There may be multiple modifications between different files that depend on one another through Git. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows what has been committed. Git diff shows the difference between file versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert your changes. You will always have a reference. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Respository.
